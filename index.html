                            The core of Minecraft lies in block manipulation.
                            Every corner of this world is made up of
                            three-dimensional blocks. These blocks represent
                            natural elements such as earth, stone, minerals and
                            logs, among others. Your task is to explore, collect
                            and use these blocks to create and shape your
                            environment as you wish.
                            <br><br>
                            Imagine the possibilities: you can build impressive
                            structures, maps, fortresses, castles, mini-games,
                            and hundreds of designs with your own ideas. You can
                            also design and build "farms", ingenious structures
                            and mechanisms that take advantage of the game's
                            unique features.

                        <b><em>Markus Persson</em></b>, also known as "Notch", is a Swedish video game developer and programmer. He is best
                        known as the creator of the hugely popular video game Minecraft. He founded Mojang Studios, the company
                        responsible for the development of Minecraft, and played a vital role in the game's early development.
                        <br><br>
                        Notch was born on June 1, 1979 in Stockholm, Sweden. He has been passionate about programming since he
                        was 7 years old, and spent his adult life working for video game companies such as King Digital
                        Entertainment and Jalbum. In 2009, he started developing Minecraft and <strong>released an alpha version to the
                        public in 2010</strong>.
                        <br><br>
                        Under Notch's leadership, Minecraft was a huge success, with the game gaining a huge following of
                        players around the world. In 2014, Microsoft  spent a huge sum of money to acquire Mojang Studios,
                        including the copyright of "Minecraft".
                        <br><br>
                        Notch's contributions to the video game industry and his role in creating one of the most influential
                        and beloved video games of all time make him an important figure in video game history. But it's worth
                        noting that Notch's public statements and actions on social media sparked debate about his views and his
                        impact on the community, and were removed from Minecraft by Microsoft.

                        <dfn><em><strong>Infiniminer</strong></em></dfn> was an online construction and exploration video game released in 2009. 
                        It was developed by Zachtronics Industries and is considered one of the precursors and sources of inspiration for the
                        popular game <strong>Minecraft</strong>.
                        <br><br>
                        In <strong>Infiniminer</strong>, players worked together in a three-dimensional world, collecting resources and
                        building structures using blocks. The game focused on mining and collecting resources such as minerals
                        and materials to create objects and buildings. Players could choose between different roles, such as
                        miners, builders or explorers, to contribute to the development and expansion of the world.
                        <br><br>
                        The game was based on friendly competition between teams to complete specific objectives, such as
                        collecting the most resources or building impressive structures. As players excavated and built, they
                        also had to watch out for the possibility of landslides and collapses in the terrain.

                    <p>
                        In Survival Mode, players are immersed in challenging environments where they must gather necessary
                        resources such as wood, stone, and food in order to survive. In addition to managing their health
                        and hunger, they must also defend themselves from enemies such as monsters and hostile creatures
                        that appear at night. Players can use the crafting system to create tools, weapons, and shelters to
                        survive and thrive in this world.

                        all resources and blocks in the game, allowing them to build without restrictions. They can fly
                        freely around the world and do not have to worry about health, hunger or environmental hazards. This
                        mode is ideal for building your crazy ideas.

                        Adventure mode is designed for more guided and specific experiences. In this mode, players can
                        explore custom worlds created by other players or the community. Unlike survival mode, here players
                        cannot destroy blocks freely and can only interact with predetermined elements as designed by the
                        map creator. This allows for the creation of challenging puzzles, quests and themed maps.
